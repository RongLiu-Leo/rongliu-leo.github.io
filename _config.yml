  I'm a Research Engineer affiliated with the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, and my research passion lies in the intersection of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 

  Currently, my primary focus is on projects related to 3D vision, with a special emphasis on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

          We aim to extend 3D Gaussian Splatting, currently limited to RGB rendering and loss, by incorporating differentiable outputs inspired by the versatile Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), thus enabling advanced research and novel loss functions for improved volumetric analysis.
